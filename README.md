ðŸ‘‹ Hi,
Iâ€™m @GustavogdcostaI and I discovered my passion and aptitude as a Full Stack developer. My expertise includes creating web applications with the best design practices, using modern frameworks, in addition to keeping the entire project responsive and running in the best way possible. At EBAC, I acquired comprehensive skills in back-end and front-end development, as well as experience in systems integration and testing with APIs. With 8 years of experience as an engineer, I developed solid technical and personal skills, in addition to leading teams of project professionals. Now I bring this experience to the development area. Additionally, I plan to expand my knowledge with additional courses as App Development and obtain a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering to further enhance my career in software development.
